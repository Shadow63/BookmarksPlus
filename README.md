# Bookmarks Plus
**Bookmarks Plus** - Team Jellyfish's Project for HackNC 2019.  
Created within the span of just 24 hours.  

Ever wanted to open multiple websites with only one click? Ever 
want to open multiple bookmarks at once without needing to
save your browser session? Ever want to sign into websites with 
just a single click? This is the program for you!  
  
Built with Python, PyQt, and Selenium, our GUI-interface program 
lets you create "bookspaces" (short for bookmark workspaces) 
that store multiple sites. Each time you create a bookspace, our 
program creates an associated Python script that you can run 
with just a single click in the main GUI window. You can also delete 
bookspaces or store log-in information to auto-log-into sites!
